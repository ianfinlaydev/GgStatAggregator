🃏 GGPoker HUD Tracker

A web application to track, aggregate, and persist player HUD data for GGPoker sessions.

🧠 What This App Does (in plain English)

If you play online poker on GGPoker, you’ve probably noticed that the site limits what player statistics you can see—and those stats disappear as soon as your table closes.

This app solves that problem.
It lets you manually enter key data about opponents during or after your games (like how often someone plays hands, raises, or goes all-in). The app then:

-Aggregates the data across multiple sessions.
-Calculates a weighted average of their stats.
-Formats and copies a summary string into your clipboard.
-You can then paste it directly into GGPoker’s player notes, so the insights are always at your fingertips—session after session.

Think of it like a digital memory aid that helps you remember how someone plays, even weeks later.

💡 Why I Built This

I designed and built this application as part of my learning journey and portfolio to demonstrate:

-My ability to work with modern web technologies like C# and Blazor.
-Real-world use of Entity Framework Core and SQL Server for data persistence.
-Use of MudBlazor, a UI component library, to create a clean, responsive interface.
-Thoughtful software design patterns for extensibility and maintainability.

This project reflects how I approach development: by building something useful, real-world applicable, and thoughtfully engineered from the ground up.
